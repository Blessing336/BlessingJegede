                    <li>Stick to trips that were NOT sent via “store and forward”
                    </li>
                    <li>Only interested in street-hailed trips paid by card or cash, with a standard rate</li>
                    <li>Remove any trips with dates before 2017 or after 2020, along with any trips with 
                        pickups or drop-offs into unknown zones</li>
                    <li>Any trip with no recorded passengers had 1 passenger</li>
                    <li>If a pickup date/time is AFTER the drop-off date/time, Swap them
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove trips lasting longer than a day, and any trips which show both a distance 
                        and fare amount of 0</li>
                    <li>If you notice any record where the fare, taxes, and surcharges are ALL negative, please 
                        make them positive</li>
                    <li>For any trips that have a fare amount but have a trip distance of 0, calculate the distance 
                        this way: (Fare amount - 2.5) / 2.5</li>
                    <li>For any trips that have a trip distance but have a fare amount of 0, calculate the fare 
                        amount this way: 2.5 + (trip distance x 2.5)</li></br></br></br>
